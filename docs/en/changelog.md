## Changelog

## v0.1.3

Improvements
- AdaTAD's results on Multi-THUMOS are released at [here](../../configs/adatad/README.md#multi-thumos-results). We achieve an amazing performance of 48.73% average mAP on Multi-THUMOS dataset.

Bug Fixes
- The annotation of MultiTHUMOS dataset is updated. We fix few wrong annotations, and manually remove those actions longer than the video duration. The corresponding results of ActionFormer and TemporalMaxer are also updated, which are very close to the previous results.


### v0.1.2 (2024/06/06)

New features
- OpenTAD supports temporal checkpointing now, which is proposed in ETAD and can save more memory during end-to-end training. Check [here](../../configs/etad/README.md).
- We support Ego4D-MQ dataset now. Please check [here](../../tools/prepare_data/ego4d/README.md) to download the annotation and features, and [here](../../configs/actionformer/ego4d_internvideo.py) for an implementation on ActionFormer.
- We release the config and pretrained checkpoints of AdaTAD on EPIC-KITCHENS and Ego4D datasets. Please check [here](../../configs/adatad/README.md).

Improvements
- VSGN now supports THUMOS dataset.
- ETAD now supports end-to-end training.
